if only + half-level, how to avoid feat and attribute taxes? I prefer meaningful choices rather than necessary ones.
STR, CON, DEX, INT, WIS, CHA
starting attributes:
- 16, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10
- ?
2d10 + modifiers
- modifiers are:
  - attribute modifier (written as ATTR, or STR, etc.)
  - half level
  - proficiency
  - situational benefits/bonuses
  - conditions
  - item bonuses
  - feat bonuses
  - power bonuses
  - situational penalties
  - power penalties
defense
- HP
  - Constitution + class starting + class per level + ? + bonuses
- AC
  - 10 + max of DEX and INT if in light + half level + bonuses
- Fortitude
  - 10 + max of STR and CON + half level + bonuses
- Reflex
  - 10 + max of DEX and INT + half level + bonuses
- Will
  - 10 + max of WIS and CHA + half level + bonuses
advantage is 3d10, keep 2
disadvantage is 3d10, lowest 2
any amount of advantage is canceled out by any amount of disadvantage
advantage/disadvantage is from magical effects, class features; not situational modifiers
levels 1-30?
- 3 tiers - 1-10, 11-20, 21-30?
powers have 3 versions: tier 1, tier 2, and tier 3
at end of tier, all your powers should be from that tier
at the end of tier 2, you could have the upgraded, tier 2 version of a power you originally picked up in tier 1
- ex, fireball as level 5 daily doing 4d6 damage
- could do 8d6 damage as level 15 daily
- or become level 13 encounter at 5d6
