# Fighter

## Talents

10 Feat Points? Should be roughly 6.

Combat Challenge - Bane Focus+ (?) (Provoked 4) (3)
- In combat, it’s dangerous to ignore a fighter. Every time you attack an enemy, whether the attack hits or misses, you can choose to Provoke 1 that target. The target remains Provoked until the end of your next turn. While a target is Provoked, it suffers disadvantage 1 on attack rolls for any attack that doesn't include you as a target. A new Provoke supersedes a Provoke that was already in place. In addition, whenever a Provoked enemy that is adjacent to you shifts or makes an attack that does not include you, you can make a melee basic attack against that enemy as an immediate interrupt.

Combat Superiority - Opportunity Reflexes I (?) (2), Opportunity Punisher I (?) (Immobile) (2-3)
- You gain advantage 1 on opportunity attacks. An enemy struck by your opportunity attack suffers instantaneous Immobile, if a move provoked the attack. If it still has actions remaining, it can use them to resume moving.

Fighter Weapon Talent - Attack Specialization I (One-Handed or Two-Handed) (3)
- Choose either one-handed or two-handed weapons.
    - One-handed Melee - The weapon uses a single hand and allows the other hand to be used for carrying another object, second weapon, or kept free for other actions. When wielding a one-handed weapon in each hand, if neither has the defensive property, you gain advantage 1 to all melee attacks. If both weapons you are wielding have passive benefits such as the defensive property, use the best of the two benefits; they are not added together.
    - Two-Handed Melee - The weapon requires two hands to wield and cannot be used with a shield or other weapon. Two-handed melee weapons grant advantage 1 to all attacks.
