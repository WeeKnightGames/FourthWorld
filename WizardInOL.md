# Wizard

Has At-wills and Dailies, but no Encounters.

## Talents

10 Feat Points? Should be roughly 6.

- Cantrips
    - Cantrips are minor spells you gain at 1st level. You can use the ghost sound, light, mage hand, and prestidigitation cantrips as at-will powers.
- Ritual Casting
    - You gain the Ritual Caster feat (page 200) as a bonus feat, allowing you to use magical rituals (see Chapter 10).
- Spellbook
    - You possess a spellbook, a book full of mystic lore in which you store your rituals and your daily and utility spells.
    - Rituals:
        - Your book contains three 1st-level rituals of your choice that you have mastered.
        - At 5th level, and again at 11th, 15th, 21st, and 25th level, you master two more rituals of your choice and add them to your spellbook. Any ritual you add must be your level or lower.
    - Daily and Utility Spells:
        - Your spellbook also holds your daily and utility spells. You begin knowing two daily spells, one of which you can use on any given day. Each time you gain a level that lets you select a daily spell or a utility spell, choose two different daily spells or utility spells of that level to add to your book.
        - After an extended rest, you can prepare a number of daily and utility spells according to what you can cast per day for your level. You can’t prepare the same spell twice.
        - If you replace a spell because of gaining a level or through retraining, the previous spell vanishes from your spellbook and is replaced by the new spell.
    - Capacity:
        - A typical spellbook has 128 pages. Each spell takes up 1 page. A ritual takes up a number of pages equal to its level.
