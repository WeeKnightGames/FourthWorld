# Idea for Fourth World game:

Tactical combat, gamist approach, based on D&D, PF, and 13A:

1. D&D 3.5e SRD
2. D&D 5e SRD
3. 13A SRD
4. PF 1e SRD
5. PF 2e SRD ?

When expert, proficiency bonus = Level + 1
When trained, proficiency bonus = Level
When untrained, proficiency bonus = Level / 2 (round down)
Attribute bonus = either normal +1 for 12-13, +2 for 14-15, etc.
  or try +d4 for 12-13, +d6 for 14-15, ..., +d12 for 20.

At-Will
Encounter
Daily
Utility

Either specific numbers of each you can use - like 3 encounter powers (and can choose any you have) -or- have 3 differenct encounter powers that can each be used once.

At certain levels, change Daily power of certain level or lower to Encounter power.
Maybe Fireball starts as daily at level 3 but at level 7 can become an encounter power.
Perhaps at another point an Encounter power can become an At-Will power.
Maybe this instead of new power or in addition to new power to avoid losing old cool powers and having lots of near duplicates.
